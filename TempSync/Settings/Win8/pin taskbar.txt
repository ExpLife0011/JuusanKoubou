To solve this issue do the following:

Start Google Chrome (this creates a new taskbar icon);
Right click on the new icon and select "Pin this program to taskbar";
Go to:
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar
You will see the two pinned Google Chrome.lnk here. Delete the Google Chrome.lnk and make Google Chrome (1).lnk readonly (Right Click -> Properties -> General tab -> tick Read-only -> Click OK);
